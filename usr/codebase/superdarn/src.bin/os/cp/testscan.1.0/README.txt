Description:
===========
testscan is a variant on the normalscan radar control program
that performs a 1-min scan in a non-standard manner. The beam
sequence is slightly adjusted such that the scan no longer starts
on the overlapping meridional beams of a dual-site MSI-style
radar to try debugging the noise problem on those beams.
