The following radar control programs are intercompatible with
one another for dual-channel operation:

- normalscan       [*]
- pcodescan        [*]
- interleavescan
- rbspscan
- onebeamscan
- normalsound_usrp [+]

[*] Note that normalscan and pcodescan are not compatible with
    one another; however, both control programs are compatible
    with any other mode in the list above.

[+] normalsound_usrp may require a 10 MHz receive bandwidth in
    the python UHD server depending on the minimum and maximum
    frequencies in the radar's sounder.dat file.
