By default, all control programs use the generic "ros" site library
which is compatible with any radar and reads from the site-specific
configuration files (found along SD_SITE_PATH).

Note the legacy "cve" and "cvw" site libraries are retained in this
directory for reference purposes only. They can however still be used
instead of the generic "ros" site library by modifying the 'libstr'
value in the appropriate radar control program (either in the source
code or as a command line argument).
